Water quality monitoring plays a significant 
role in the transition towards intelligent and smart 
agriculture. As new technologies are continuously 
developed and adopted in agricultural and daily human 
life, there is a need for reliable models with accurate and 
thorough datasets. In this review article, the authors 
analyze water quality monitoring models that utilize 
sensors gathering water properties during live 
experiments. The goal is to convey conclusions regarding 
concerns, issues, difficulties, and research gaps that have 
existed over the past five years (2018â€“2022). The study 
explores real-time automated IoT-based systems for 
water quality monitoring, including pH, temperature, 
ammonia, and nitrate levels.These systems enable 
aquaponics farmers to monitor water quality effectively
